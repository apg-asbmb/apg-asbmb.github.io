<details><summary>Guest talk by Dr Sheena McGowan:</summary>
<p>
<br>
Sheena McGowan is formally trained as a microbiologist, however, during her PhD she developed what would become a long-standing interest in structure and function of proteins. 
She completed a post-doctoral position with Prof James Whisstock where she was trained in protein crystallography and biochemistry. 
She used the award of an ARC Future Fellowship to establish her own laboratory. 
<br>
<br>
The McGowan laboratory is a structural microbiology laboratory that focuses on therapeutically important microbial proteins and characterises how these proteins function on an atomic level. 
They investigate whether interruption of this function has therapeutic potential and then use this structural information to discover lead molecules and guide drug development.
