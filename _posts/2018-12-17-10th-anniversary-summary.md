The APG committee would like to thank everyone for helping to celebrate 10 years of the APG!
Special thanks to Frances Separovic for an excellent and inspiring talk, 
the [ASBMB and our sponsors](/Supporters/) for their ongoing support, and of course the APG community!

Over the last 10 years the APG has hosted 27 events for Adelaide researchers, 
providing a platform for collaboration, 
and a forum for students and early career researchers to share their work with $17,000 worth of prizes awarded to 28 winners!
