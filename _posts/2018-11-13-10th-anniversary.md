This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Adelaide Protein Group. 
To celebrate, our annual end of year networking function will be a little bit special. 

## Breaking barriers with membrane-active peptides

Our keynote speaker is Prof. Frances Separovic, Professor of Chemistry, Deputy Director of the Bio21 Institute and former Head of School at the University of Melbourne. 
Her primary research interest is the determination of the structure and dynamics of membrane components in situ using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
