The APG committee would like to thank everyone involved in helping to deliver an excellent symposium. 
Thanks especially to our IT team without which we could not have hosted a hybrid in-person and online event. 
Thanks to the judges for their time, the presenters for giving fantastic talks, the attendees, and our supporters!
